# Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* DOI has been added to package description.
* Unexecutable code removed from man/formatFields.Rd
* created small exectubable @examples for all functions excepting the one listed below.
* @examples for function move2KBA() remain with \dontrun as they involve download of datasets from an external website and so specifying specific parameters in the function call will be inherently unstable.

# Version 1.0.0

* Windows (on local and GitHub Actions), R release
