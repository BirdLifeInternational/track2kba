# Patch change
This is a patch to deal with CRAN ERRORs/NOTEs. In this version I have:

* Shortened runtimes of package examples
* Tested package on solaris, fedora (using rhub), dealing with ERRORs and NOTEs that arose on those OSs.

# Version 1.0.1

## Test environments
* Windows (on local and GitHub Actions), R release
* Ubuntu 20.04 (on GitHub Actions), R release
* Ubuntu 20.04 (on GitHub Actions), devel
* macOS (on GitHub Actions), R release

## R CMD check results
