Description: This package provides functions for preparing
    and analyzing animal tracking data, with the intention of identifying
    areas which are potentially important at the population level, and
    therefore of conservation interest. Areas identified using this
    package may be checked against global or regionally-defined criteria,
    such as those set by the Key Biodiversity Area program. The method
    published herein is an optimized and updated version of the Lascelles
    et al. 2016 method.
