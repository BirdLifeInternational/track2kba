Ideas from 2019-02-19 meeting: 
	
Main changes to existing functions: 
A. tripSplit: 
B. tripSummary: 
C. scaleARS: (now built into findH function)
D. batchUD: Anyone
E. varianceTest: (Jono)
	1. Compare with Virginiaâ€™s IndEffectTest()
F. bootstrap: Martin + Lizzie 
	1. replace polygon-points overlay with raster-points overlay (Martin)
	- add output if nls fails --> inclusion mean of maximum sample size
G. polyCount: (replaced with findIBA function)
H. thresholdRaster: (replaced with findIBA function)
I. findIBA (ought to be named findKBA)
	- add landmass to plotting output (Martin)
J. findScale
	- decide on way to relate foraging range to a potential H value (see spatial H sensitivity script )
	- other H-value determination methods to add?
	- scaleARS input parameters still ought to be fixed in some reasonable way (range and step length)
H. move2KBA

		

General things to work on:
	- replace 'representativity' with correct, 'representativeness'
